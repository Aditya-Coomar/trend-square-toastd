### Viewing the Project
#### Local Development
After starting the development server:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
2. The project will be running in development mode with hot-reload enabled, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically update in the browser.

- If the project runs on a different port, you'll see the correct URL in your terminal after running `npm run dev`
- For the best experience, use modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
