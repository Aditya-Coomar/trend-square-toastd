<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Coomar/trend-square-toastd.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Viewing the Project

#### Local Development
After starting the development server:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. The project will be running in development mode with hot-reload enabled, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically update in the browser.

### Note
- Make sure port 3000 is available on your system for local development
- If the project runs on a different port, you'll see the correct URL in your terminal after running `npm run dev`
- For the best experience, use modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
